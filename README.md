## ZK Compression

Feather Assets utilizes zero-knowledge (ZK) compression technology, providing several key advantages:

- **Scalability**: Significantly increased throughput compared to traditional on-chain assets
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Reduced transaction costs due to compressed data accounts
- **Security**: Maintains the security guarantees of Solana's L1
- **Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing Solana infrastructure

These ZK-compressed assets offer the best of both worlds: the robustness of L1 with the performance of L2 solutions.

## Delegation and Rental

Feather Assets supports various forms of asset delegation:

1. **Privilege-based Delegation**: Delegate specific privileges (e.g., transfer, burn).
2. **Rental**: Temporarily rent asset ownership with specific privileges for a specified duration.
